## About This Blog

This blog documents my Google Summer of Code 2025 journey with GNOME. Here, I share my experiences, technical insights, challenges, and learnings as I contribute to one of the most important open source desktop environments in the world.

## About Me

I'm Ahmed Fatthi Al-Khateeb, a passionate software developer with a strong commitment to open source software. My journey into programming began with a fascination for creating tools that help people, and I've been captivated by the collaborative nature of open source development ever since.

### My Background
- üéì **Education**: Computer Science student with focus on software engineering
- üíº **Experience**: Active GNOME contributor with multiple accepted merge requests
- üîß **Skills**: C/C++, Python, GTK, GLib, Git, Linux development, UI/UX design
- üåü **Interests**: Open source development, desktop environments, user experience design, document management systems

### Why GNOME?

GNOME represents everything I love about open source:
- **User-Centric Design**: Focus on creating intuitive, accessible experiences
- **Community Driven**: Collaborative development with contributors worldwide
- **Technical Excellence**: High-quality code and innovative solutions
- **Social Impact**: Software that empowers millions of users globally

## My GSoC 2025 Project

### Project Details
- **Organization**: GNOME
- **Project Title**: Backend Isolation for GNOME Papers
- **Mentors**: Pablo Correa G√≥mez, Markus Gollnitz, Lucas Baudin, Qiu Wenbo
- **Duration**: May 2025 - August 2025

### Project Goals
This project focuses on enhancing GNOME Papers by implementing backend isolation to improve security, stability, and performance. The main objectives include:

- **Sandbox Integration**: Implementing proper sandboxing for document rendering backends
- **Security Hardening**: Isolating potentially unsafe document processing operations
- **Performance Optimization**: Improving resource management and memory usage
- **Code Quality**: Refactoring and modernizing the existing codebase
- **User Experience**: Ensuring seamless functionality while enhancing security

### My GNOME Contributions

I've been actively contributing to GNOME projects with several accepted merge requests:

**GNOME Papers:**
- [MR #499](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/papers/-/merge_requests/499): Document handling improvements
- [MR #526](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/papers/-/merge_requests/526): UI/UX enhancements
- [MR #525](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/papers/-/merge_requests/525): Bug fixes and optimizations

**GNOME Evolution:**
- [MR #191](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/evolution/-/merge_requests/191): Email client improvements

**GNOME File Roller:**
- [MR #135](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/file-roller/-/merge_requests/135): Archive handling enhancements

These contributions demonstrate my commitment to the GNOME ecosystem and provide a solid foundation for my GSoC project.
